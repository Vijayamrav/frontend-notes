types of opeartors:

1)conditional operators also known as ternary operators
ternary operator is the only operator which takes three arguments.
ternary operator is used to assign value to a variable based on a condition.

2)uniary operators 
 +,-,++,--,!,~,void,delete

3)relational operators
>,<,>=,<=,==,===

4)bitwise operators
bitwise opeartors are used to interact with the variables at bit level
bitwise AND(&)
bitwise OR(|)
XOR(^)
NOT(~)
LEFT SHIFT(<<)  exmaple 5<<1 5 in binary form is shifted to the left by 1 position
RIGHT SHIFT(>>) exmaple 5>>1 in binary from is shifted to right by 1 position

5)logical opeartors
logical AND
logical OR 
NOT
nullish operator(??)
