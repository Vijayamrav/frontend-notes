this keyword
if the value of this keyword is null or undefined then this keyword is replaced with global object only in  non strict mode

note:this keyword value depends on how fucntion is called

value of this in object method is the object itself
example:
obj={
  a:10,
  func:function (){
console.log(this)
}
}
}
//output:{
a:10,
func:f()
}

note:when working with iife make sure to end the statement which is above the iife with semicolon.
